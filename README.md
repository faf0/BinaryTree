BinaryTree
==========

Simple binary tree implementation in Java that supports
node key types which implement the interface Comparable.

The implementation allows to encode BinaryTree instances as a string.
Conversely, encoded binary tree strings can be converted to BinaryTree
instances.

Encoding Format
---------------

The following encoded string represents a binary tree with
a root node that has value 95.
The key of the root's left child node is 38.

	95(l38(l29(l21))(r39(r60(l42)(r93(l88)))))
